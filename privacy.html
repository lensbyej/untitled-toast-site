    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 7, 2026</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Untitled Toast</strong> ("we,"
      "our," or "us") handles information across all applications, software,
      and services published under the Untitled Toast name (collectively,
      the "Apps").
    </p>

    <p>
      We are committed to protecting user privacy and designing our Apps
      with data minimization as a core principle.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to all current and future Apps developed
      or distributed by Untitled Toast, unless a specific App provides a
      separate privacy policy that supersedes this document.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      By default, our Apps do <strong>not</strong> require user accounts and
      do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names</li>
      <li>Email addresses</li>
      <li>Phone numbers</li>
      <li>Physical addresses</li>
      <li>Government-issued identifiers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If an App ever requires personal information to function, it will be
      clearly disclosed within that App and, where required, through an
      updated privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>Our Apps do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Usage analytics</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Behavioral tracking data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or third-party advertising
      technologies unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Some Apps may request device permissions strictly to enable core
      features. These may include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera access</li>
      <li>Photo or media library access</li>
      <li>Local storage access</li>
      <li>Microphone access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permissions are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requested only when necessary</li>
      <li>Used only for user-initiated actions</li>
      <li>Limited to on-device functionality unless explicitly stated otherwise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Processing</h2>
    <p>Unless explicitly disclosed within a specific App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is stored locally on the user’s device</li>
      <li>Data is processed on-device</li>
      <li>Data is not transmitted to Untitled Toast servers</li>
      <li>Untitled Toast does not have access to user-generated content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Users remain in full control of their data, including deletion through
      standard device or App controls.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our Apps do <strong>not</strong> integrate third-party services that
      collect user data by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a specific App uses third-party services (such as cloud storage,
      analytics, or external APIs), such usage will be clearly disclosed
      within that App, including the nature of data shared and the purpose
      of the integration.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Apps are not designed to knowingly collect personal information
      from children under the age of 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe that a child has provided personal information through
      one of our Apps, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data handled by our Apps. Since
      most data remains on-device, security is primarily governed by the
      user’s device operating system and security settings.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will
      be reflected by an updated "Last updated" date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of our Apps after changes are made constitutes acceptance
      of the updated Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>

      privacy practices, you may contact us at:
